* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue

### Gender Demographics

* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
The below each broken by gender

### Age Demographics
The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. &lt;10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)

### Top Spenders
Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

### Most Popular Items

**Observations:**
After reviewing all the data following observation can be made:

1. There are a total number of 576 players in game out of which around 84% are male who are purchasing the items.
2. The highest number of buyers belong to the age group of 20-24, with a total count of 258, which is 44.79% of the total players
3. The most profitable and most popular item is "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" with Item ID = 178, while its not the most expensive its quite popular and high sales have lead to highest revenue from the item.
4. The top spender is "Lisosia93", maybe a targeted promotion can be run to capture more from this and top five buyers.
